New ASR Snippet Template: One-Scene S2D,Firefox,Messaging System,enhancement,P1,--,VERIFIED FIXED,Firefox 80,"Attached image          Second-scene of existing S2D template        — Details Hi Tim, we'd need it for Firefox 80 (release date: 2020-08-25) at the very latest to have ready for our big 'September Moment' campaigns, but if it's possible to get sooner so we can test with it before then, that'd be ideal. Especially knowing it will require some time/work on Giorgos' end to expose the new template to the snippet service authoring tool in order for us to begin utilizing it. (In reply to Giorgos Logiotatidis [:giorgos] from comment #4)I suggest that we don't include the Dismiss button and only display the block button as we do with the rest one-scene snippets.What do you think Lisa?(in this case we don't need scene2_dismiss_button_text)Agreed! I provided my UI suggestions in the last paragraph of the description above.""Ideally this template would be smaller than the current second-scene of our S2D template today, see attached screenshot (e.g. rather than having a large logo above the text, we could use a smaller logo to the left of the text like our standard snippets + the dismiss button/bar could be replaced by a hover-over 'x' like our standard one-scene snippets), but it would need to be larger than a simple snippet in order for the S2D form to fit."" Hi Andrei, thanks for the update! I'll connect with our OMN designer to mock-up what we're thinking and get back to you as soon as possible. We're actually hoping to make this even smaller/ more narrow.Are you working against specific dates we should be aware of to ensure this gets in for Fx80? I don't want to cause any delays since we'll need it to ride that train. Hi Andrei,I've attached two mock-ups for what we were thinking (one very similar to what you already had just with the ""Let's do this!"" headline removed, we don't think that will be necessary); the overall goal being to keep this as narrow as possible (with minimal padding on top and bottom).v01: This is similar to what you already have with guidance on image placement.v02: This one would actually be ideal, but I'm unsure if it's feasible. Might be too crammed / restrict the actual snippet copy character count too much.One thing I wanted to note just to be sure it gets captured for either approach: post-""Send"" click, someone should see a Success screen (assuming you've filled things out correctly and it doesn't throw an error message first, e.g. ""Your download link was sent.""), similar to the existing two-scene S2D template experience (I guess it's the third-scene in that case) -- I've attached a screenshot showing what I mean.Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions!

Remove registration for FTP support on Windows,Firefox,Installer,task,P1,--,VERIFIED FIXED,Firefox 78,"One of the protocols that the Windows installer registers us with the OS as a handler for is ftp:, but we're dropping support for that in bug 1574475, so we should stop claiming to support it here. This means both no longer registering support for the protocol on new installs, and also removing the existing registration during updates.The removal of support is starting by putting a pref in front of the whole feature. Currently that pref is disabled only for Nightly, and I haven't seen a timeline for letting that ride the trains (the original plan was to do that in 77 with an exception for ESR 78, but that's been delayed). Having this change landed while only Nightly is affected isn't critical, but we should definitely be ready when the pref change does start riding the trains. "
